(1) Function in PHP: A function is a piece of code which takes one more input in the form of parameter and does some processing and returns a value.

There are two parts of function−−−

*Creating a PHP Function
*Calling a PHP Function



(2) Conditionally created function: Conditionally creating functions  means defining a function based on certain conditions being met. 

As like,
 *if & else

The list of conditional function:
*class_exists()
*interface_exixts()
*method_exists()
*propertity_exixts()
*trait_exists()


(3) Function Returning value: A function can return a value using the return statement in conjunction with a value or object. return stops the execution of the function
          and sends the value back to the calling code.



(4) Passing Arguments by Reference: In PHP, arguments are usually passed by value, which means that a copy of the value is used in the function and the variable that was 
           passed into the function cannot be changed.

    When a function argument is passed by reference, changes to the argument also change the variable that was passed in. To turn a function argument into a reference, the
    & operator is used:


(5) Argument Passing By Value:  When you pass by value, a copy of the variable's value is passed to the function, leaving the original variable unchanged outside of the
    function's scope. This means that modifications made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original variable.
